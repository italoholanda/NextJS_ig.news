## About
This project consists of a blog with private content, where the user needs to make a paid subscription to access it.

To limit access, we will use **#Stripe** for payment method and **#FaunaDB** for storing user data and subscriptions. Also, we need a content provider for the posts, so we use **#PrismicCMS** for that.

We'd like Google to be able to index our posts, so we show a little preview of our posts statically via **#NextJS**'s SSG rendering.

This is a great example of using the **#JAMStack** architecture, using a **#Serverless** logic on the front-end.
