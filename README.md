## About
This project consists of a blog with private content, where the user needs to make a paid subscription to access it.

To limit access, we will use #Stripe for payment method and #FaunaDB for storing user data and subscriptions. Also, we need a content provider for the posts, so we use #PrismicCMS for that.

We'd like Google to be able to index our posts, so we show a little preview of our posts statically via #NextJS's SSG rendering.

This is a great example of using the #JAMStack architecture, using a #Serverless logic on the front-end.
